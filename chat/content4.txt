中文：本实用新型涉及一种便于蒸发结晶器的管路堵塞清堵装置,包括前引体,前引体的外部设有锥壳,锥壳上依次均匀的分布设有拨带和导槽,前引体右末端设有接头,前引体右侧设有扶正体,扶正体外部均匀的设有导流带,相邻的导流带之间设有通流沟,导流带与通流沟均呈螺旋状,扶正体后部设有活杆体,扶正体与活杆体之间设有转动接头,扶正体通过转动接头与活杆体连接。本实用新型采用前引体上的拨带可以将管路内的淤积物进行钻起,拨动下的碎物可以通过导槽进行向后排出,通过扶正体和活杆体内的螺旋状的通流沟可以将碎物不断的进行排出,使管路可以快速的进行疏通,清堵的效果好,清堵的操作方便,无需切断管路,省时省力,节省维护成本。
英文：The utility model relates to a device convenient for removing blockage of a pipeline of an evaporation crystallizer, which comprises a front pull-up body, a conical shell arranged outside the front pull-up body, a shifting belt and a guide groove which are uniformly distributed on the conical shell in sequence, a joint arranged at the right tail end of the front pull-up body, a centralizing body arranged on the right side of the front pull-up body, and flow guide belts uniformly arranged outside the centralizing body, a flow guide belt is arranged at the rear end of the centralizing body, a through-flow channel is arranged between every two adjacent flow guide belts, the flow guide belts and the through-flow channels are spiral, a movable rod body is arranged on the rear portion of the centralizing body, a rotating connector is arranged between the centralizing body and the movable rod body, and the centralizing body is connected with the movable rod body through the rotating connector. According to the pipeline dredging device, sediments in a pipeline can be drilled through the poking belt on the front pull-up body, the poked debris can be discharged backwards through the guide groove, and the debris can be continuously discharged through the spiral through-flow channels in the centralizing body and the movable rod body, so that the pipeline can be quickly dredged, the dredging effect is good, and the pipeline dredging device is simple in structure and convenient to use. Blockage clearing operation is convenient, a pipeline does not need to be cut off, time and labor are saved, and maintenance cost is saved.
